This is a simple production calculator for Satisfactory. It requires python to be installed on your computer as well as MySQL. MySQL database must be setup before using the calculator.
In order to connect it to your MySQL database you must modify the login.txt to match your server, database, uid and password.

DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 9.0 ANSI Driver};SERVER=(yourserverhere);DATABASE=(yourDBhere);UID=(yourUIDhere);PWD=(yourpasswordhere)
                                                  
I've included a bat file that will launch the calculator.
This is my first project, so if there's any bugs please let me know.
